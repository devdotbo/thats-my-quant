# Build Plan for a Robust, Profitable Trading-Research Platform

The plan is structured around six pillars: **Data**, **Research Workflow**, **Execution Realism**, **Risk & Validation**, **Automation**, and **Governance**.

---

## 1. Data

| Goal | Actions |
|------|---------|
| High-integrity, survivorship-bias-free data | - Use full-history reference data (Polygon, Norgate, Quandl).<br>- Store raw files immutably (S3/MinIO) and tag with checksum/version. |
| Fast access & preprocessing | - Parquet + Zstd or Feather for columnar storage.<br>- Implement lazy-loading cache layer (LRU with size caps). |
| Point-in-time corporate actions | - Maintain split/dividend database.<br>- Adjust OHLCV on read, never overwrite raw. |
| Feature generation | - Vectorised indicator engine (numba/pandas-ta).<br>- Compute incremental deltas to avoid full recomputation. |

---

## 2. Research Workflow

1. **Hypothesis → Notebook Prototype → Formal Strategy Class**  
   Use Jupyter + papermill for experiments; once hypothesis shows signal, promote to `src/strategies/` plugin.
2. **Versioned Experiments**  
   Metadata (parameters, commit hash, data snapshot ID) saved with every back-test result to assure reproducibility.
3. **Parameter Search Discipline**  
   - Nested cross-validation: train/validation/test to avoid look-ahead.<br>
   - Bayesian optimisation (optuna) over grid search.

## 3. Execution Realism

| Component | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Transaction Costs | Tiered commission, dynamic spread, square-root impact. Calibrated using TAQ / order-book data. |
| Slippage | Volume-weighted average price (VWAP) model with intraday volume curve. |
| Position Sizing | Kelly-fraction constraint with volatility targeting. |
| Capital Constraints | Enforce market, sector, and symbol limits; include margin/leverage rules. |
| Corporate Events | Handle delistings, halts, and splits automatically in engine. |

---

## 4. Risk Management & Validation

- **Walk-Forward Analysis**: rolling train/test windows with parameter re-optimisation.
- **Monte-Carlo Bootstrapping**: resample trade P&L to derive return distribution and drawdown statistics.
- **Probabilistic Forecasting**: use Bayesian posterior of Sharpe and maximum drawdown.
- **Outlier & Regime Tests**: Hurst exponent, change-point detection for regime shifts.
- **Live Shadow Trading**: paper-trade strategies for X weeks before capital allocation.

---

## 5. Automation & Infrastructure

| Area | Tooling |
|------|---------|
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions: lint → test → benchmark → deploy. |
| Artefact Storage | Results & charts pushed to S3 + hashed path. |
| Reporting | Generate HTML/PDF dashboards (Plotly/kaleido + Jinja2). |
| Deployment | Docker Compose stack with scheduler (Airflow or Prefect) to run daily scans and execution. |
| Monitoring | Prometheus + Grafana for latency, error counts, P&L tracking. |

---

## 6. Governance & Continuous Improvement

- **Coding Standards**: black, isort, flake8, mypy enforced via pre-commit.
- **Dependency Hygiene**: poetry + renovatebot for pinning and upgrades.
- **Security**: git-secret for API keys, AWS IAM roles for S3 access.
- **Post-Mortems**: every strategy failure → root-cause doc & regression test.
- **Knowledge Base**: MkDocs site with architecture, onboarding, and FAQs.

### What I Would Do Differently vs. Current Repo

1. **Plugin Strategy Architecture**  
   Detach strategies into installable extras (`pip install myplatform[strategies-orb]`) to keep core lean.
2. **Remove Benchmark Code from Core Package**  
   Ship performance tests in a separate repo or as optional dependency to reduce bloat.
3. **Single Source of Config Truth**  
   Adopt [`pydantic-settings`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_settings/) for validated config, unify env & file overrides.
4. **Notebook-to-Production Pipeline**  
   Use nbdev or Jupytext to co-locate notebooks and unit-tested modules, reducing duplicate logic.
5. **Adopt Vectorised Slippage & Cost Engine in Numba**  
   Reduce Python-level loops for large universes, enabling faster portfolio simulation.

Successful implementation of the above pillars should yield strategies that survive stringent out-of-sample and live-trading tests, maximising the probability of sustained real-world profitability.
