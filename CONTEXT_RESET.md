# Context Reset Summary - That's My Quant

## Current State (as of last commit: 46440ff)

### What's Complete âœ…
1. **Project Infrastructure**
   - Full directory structure with Python packages
   - requirements.txt with all dependencies
   - config.yaml with comprehensive settings
   - pytest.ini configured with markers
   - .gitignore updated with all patterns

2. **Utility Modules (Fully Tested)**
   - `src/utils/config.py` - Configuration management (18 tests passing)
   - `src/utils/logging.py` - Structured logging system (15 tests passing)
   - Both modules have 100% documentation and type hints

3. **Base Strategy Interface**
   - `src/strategies/base.py` - Abstract base class for all strategies
   - Complete with signal generation and position sizing interfaces

4. **Benchmarking Suite**
   - Hardware performance testing (completed)
   - VectorBT speed benchmarking (0.045s for 1yr minute data âœ…)
   - Polygon.io connection verification (fixed with correct credentials)

5. **Data Pipeline (Partial)**
   - `src/data/downloader.py` - Basic implementation (needs update for date structure)
   - Integration tests written (no mocks!)
   - Download scripts created for date-based structure
   - Test data successfully extracted

6. **Critical Discoveries**
   - Polygon data organized by DATE, not symbol
   - Use API key as S3 secret (not separate secret)
   - Each daily file contains ALL symbols (~15-20MB)
   - See `POLYGON_DATA_INSIGHTS.md` for details

### What's Next ðŸš€
1. **Complete Data Download** (if still running)
   ```bash
   # Check download progress
   ls -lh data/raw/minute_aggs/daily_files/2024/*/
   
   # After download completes, extract symbols
   ./scripts/extract_symbols_year.sh
   ```

2. **Update Python Downloader**
   - Rewrite `src/data/downloader.py` for date-based structure
   - Add symbol extraction functionality
   - Update tests to match new approach

3. **Implement Remaining Data Pipeline**
   - Cache manager (src/data/cache.py) - for date-based files
   - Data preprocessor (src/data/preprocessor.py)
   - Feature engineering (src/data/features.py)

### Key Decisions Made
1. **VectorBT** as primary engine (based on speed requirements)
2. **Test-first development** - always write tests before implementation
3. **NO TODOs policy** - complete every function fully
4. **Structured logging** - JSON format for production
5. **100GB data limit** - managed by cache system

### Important Files to Read
1. `CURRENT_SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - Latest session progress and immediate tasks
2. `POLYGON_DATA_INSIGHTS.md` - Critical data structure discovery
3. `claude.md` - Development guidelines and examples
4. `implementation_status.md` - Component checklist
5. `data/README.md` - Data directory structure explanation

### Test Coverage
- Total: 33 tests across 2 modules
- All passing except 1 skipped (log rotation)
- Fixtures ready in conftest.py
- Test data generators available

### Git Status
- Clean working directory
- Latest commit includes all utilities
- Ready for fresh development

### Performance Targets
- VectorBT: <5s for 1 year minute data
- Memory: <32GB typical, <64GB peak
- Data loading: >100 MB/s
- Cache operations: <10ms

### Commands to Verify Everything
```bash
# Check git status
git status  # Should be clean

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v  # Should see 33 tests

# Check imports
python -c "from src.utils.config import get_config; print('Config OK')"
python -c "from src.utils.logging import setup_logging; print('Logging OK')"
```

## Ready to Continue! ðŸŽ¯

The project is in an excellent state for continuation. All foundational pieces are in place, tested, and documented. The next developer can immediately start on the data pipeline implementation following the patterns established.
