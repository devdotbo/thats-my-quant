# Backtesting Results Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. System Setup ✅
- Fixed environment issues (removed unused ta-lib dependency)
- Created systematic backtesting infrastructure
- Fixed all test failures and bugs

### 2. Backtesting Scripts Created ✅
- `backtest_all_symbols.py` - Runs all strategies on all symbols
- `test_backtest.py` - Quick test with 2 symbols
- `notebooks/04_portfolio_construction.ipynb` - Portfolio backtesting demo

### 3. Initial Results (2 Symbols Test)
From our test run with AAPL and SPY (full year 2024 data):

**Top Performers:**
1. **AAPL ORB_5min_3R**: Sharpe 0.44, Return 0.8%
2. **SPY ORB_5min_3R**: Sharpe -0.58, Return -0.6%

**Poor Performers:**
- Both MA strategies had very negative Sharpe ratios (-11 to -17)
- MA strategies lost 18-21% over the year

**Key Insights:**
- ORB (Opening Range Breakout) strategies performed better than MA Crossover
- Win rates around 51-53% for ORB strategies
- Current parameters may need optimization

## How to Run Full Backtests

### 1. Quick Test (2 symbols)
```bash
python test_backtest.py
```

### 2. Full Backtest (all 10 symbols)
```bash
python backtest_all_symbols.py
```

### 3. Portfolio Backtesting
Open and run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/04_portfolio_construction.ipynb
```

## Available Symbols
- AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, JPM, META, MSFT, NVDA, QQQ, SPY, TSLA

## Strategy Variations
- 3 MA Fast variations (5/20, 10/30, 15/50 periods)
- 3 MA Slow variations (20/50, 30/100, 50/200 periods)  
- 3 ORB variations (5min/3R, 15min/5R, 30min/10R)

Total: 90 backtests when running all symbols

## Output Files
Results are saved to:
- `backtest_results/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/backtest_summary.csv` - All results
- `backtest_results/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/top_strategies_report.html` - Visual report
- `backtest_results/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/full_results.json` - Detailed metrics

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Run full backtests on all symbols
2. Analyze which symbol/strategy combinations work best
3. Create portfolio from top performers

### Strategy Improvements
1. **Parameter Optimization**
   - Use walk-forward validation to find robust parameters
   - Test wider parameter ranges
   - Consider different market regimes

2. **New Strategies**
   - Mean reversion (Bollinger Band reversal)
   - Momentum (RSI breakouts)
   - Pairs trading
   - VWAP reversion

3. **Risk Management**
   - Add volatility-based position sizing
   - Implement portfolio-level stop losses
   - Dynamic allocation based on strategy performance

### Advanced Features (from Gemini recommendations)
1. **Bayesian Optimization** - Replace grid search for 10-100x faster parameter search
2. **Interactive Dashboard** - Streamlit UI for easier backtesting
3. **Factor Research Module** - Test individual signals as alpha factors
4. **Live Trading Bridge** - Connect to broker APIs (Alpaca, IB)

## Performance Benchmarks
- Backtesting speed: ~3.5 seconds per strategy on full year data
- Data loading: 102,051 bars processed in <1 second
- Can run 90 backtests in ~5-10 minutes with parallel processing

## Important Notes
- All backtests include realistic transaction costs (0.05% commission + slippage)
- Data is minute-level from 2024 (market hours only)
- Strategies are tested on actual market conditions, not simulated data
- Results show many traditional strategies struggle in current market conditions
