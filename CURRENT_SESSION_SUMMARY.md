# Current Session Summary - July 15, 2025

## 🚨 Active Download
**Full year data download in progress**: `./scripts/download_full_year.sh`
- Downloading all 2024 minute aggregates
- Estimated size: 3.6-4.8GB
- Estimated time: 30-60 minutes

## ✅ Session Achievements

### 1. Discovered Polygon Data Structure
- **CRITICAL**: Data organized by DATE, not symbol
- Each file contains ALL symbols for that day
- Path: `us_stocks_sip/minute_aggs_v1/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.csv.gz`

### 2. Fixed Credential Issues
- Added `load_dotenv()` to downloader.py
- Discovered: Use API key as S3 secret key
- Rclone configuration working

### 3. Created Download Scripts
```bash
scripts/
├── download_full_year.sh      # Main download script (running now)
├── extract_symbols_year.sh    # Extract our 10 symbols
├── download_jan_2024.sh       # Quick January download
├── extract_test_symbols.sh    # Extract from test data
└── explore_polygon_data.sh    # Explore bucket structure
```

### 4. Successfully Extracted Test Data
- Downloaded 2024-01-02 daily file
- Extracted all 10 symbols successfully
- Data in: `data/raw/minute_aggs/by_symbol/`

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. After Download Completes
```bash
# Extract symbols from downloaded data
./scripts/extract_symbols_year.sh

# Verify extraction
ls -lh data/raw/minute_aggs/by_symbol/*/*.csv.gz
```

### 2. Update Python Downloader
The current `src/data/downloader.py` assumes symbol-based downloads. Need to:
- Rewrite to download by date range
- Add extraction functionality
- Update tests for new structure

### 3. Implement Cache Manager
- Design for date-based files
- LRU eviction for daily files
- Permanent storage for extracted symbols

### 4. Create Data Preprocessor
- Load extracted symbol files
- Clean outliers
- Handle missing data
- Convert timestamps

## 🔧 Quick Commands

```bash
# Check download progress
ls -lh data/raw/minute_aggs/daily_files/2024/*/

# Test extraction on one file
gunzip -c data/raw/minute_aggs/daily_files/2024/01/2024-01-02.csv.gz | grep "^SPY," | wc -l

# Run tests
pytest tests/test_data/ -v

# Check disk usage
du -sh data/
```

## 📊 Data Status
- Test data: ✅ (2024-01-02 extracted)
- Full 2024 data: 🔄 (downloading)
- Symbol extraction: ✅ (scripts ready)
- Python implementation: ❌ (needs update)

## 🐛 Known Issues
1. Python downloader expects symbol-based structure
2. Tests need update for date-based downloads
3. Cache manager not implemented yet

## 💡 Key Insight
The date-based structure is actually beneficial:
- More efficient bulk downloads
- Natural daily batching
- Easier to maintain data freshness
- Can extract multiple symbols from same file
